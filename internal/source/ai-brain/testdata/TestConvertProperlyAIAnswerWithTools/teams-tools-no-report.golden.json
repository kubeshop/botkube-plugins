    "plaintext": "**Found Issues**\n\nThe issue you're facing is due to a missing secret named `ngin`. Secrets in Kubernetes are used to store and handle sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etc. The specific error indicates that a pod is trying to use a secret called `ngin` that doesn’t exist in the cluster. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide on how to fix it:\n\n1. **Identify the Missing Secret Requirement:**\n\n   \u003e  Ensure that the name **\"ngin\"** is correct. Sometimes, a typo in the pod configuration or secret name can cause such issues.\n\n2. Create the Secret:\n   If the secret is indeed missing `##` and you know the data that should be within it (like a token or password), you will need to create the secret. This can be done using the kubectl command line. For example, if you're creating a generic secret, you might use:\n\n    ```shell\n    kubectl create secret generic ngin --from-literal=key=value -n test\n    ```\n\n    Replace key and value with the actual data you need to store. The -n test specifies the namespace (test in this case) where the secret will be created. Adjust as necessary.\n3. **Update the Pod or Deployment Configuration:**\n   If the secret name was incorrect due to a typo in your pod or deployment configuration, you should update the relevant YAML file to correct the secret name and then apply the changes. For example:\n\n   ```yaml\n      apiVersion: v1\n      kind: Pod\n      metadata:\n        name: your-pod-name\n      spec:\n        containers:\n        - name: your-container-name\n          image: nginx\n          env:\n            - name: SECRET_KEY\n              valueFrom:\n                secretKeyRef:\n                  name: ngin  # Make sure this matches the correct secret name\n                  key: key\n   ```\n\nIf you had to update your configuration, apply the changes:\n\n```\nkubectl apply -f your-deployment.yaml\n```\n\n**Ecosystem and Community**\n\n[logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeshop/botkube/main/branding/logos/botkube-black-32x32.png)\n\n_Kubernetes_ has a ~~large~~, rapidly growing `ecosystem`.
