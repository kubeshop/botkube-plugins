**Found Issues**

The issue you're facing is due to a missing secret named `ngin`. Secrets in Kubernetes are used to store and handle sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etc. The specific error indicates that a pod is trying to use a secret called `ngin` that doesn’t exist in the cluster. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide on how to fix it:

1. **Identify the Missing Secret Requirement:**

   >  Ensure that the name **"ngin"** is correct. Sometimes, a typo in the pod configuration or secret name can cause such issues.

2. Create the Secret:
   If the secret is indeed missing `##` and you know the data that should be within it (like a token or password), you will need to create the secret. This can be done using the kubectl command line. For example, if you're creating a generic secret, you might use:

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret generic ngin --from-literal=key=value -n test
    ```

    Replace key and value with the actual data you need to store. The -n test specifies the namespace (test in this case) where the secret will be created. Adjust as necessary.
3. **Update the Pod or Deployment Configuration:**
   If the secret name was incorrect due to a typo in your pod or deployment configuration, you should update the relevant YAML file to correct the secret name and then apply the changes. For example:

   ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        name: your-pod-name
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: your-container-name
          image: nginx
          env:
            - name: SECRET_KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: ngin  # Make sure this matches the correct secret name
                  key: key
   ```

If you had to update your configuration, apply the changes:

```
kubectl apply -f your-deployment.yaml
```
