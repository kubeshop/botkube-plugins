How does Helm work?
-------------------

### **Manage Complexity**‍

Charts describe even the most complex apps, provide repeatable application installation, and serve as a single point of authority.

### **Easy Updates**‍

Take the pain out of updates with in-place upgrades and custom hooks.

### **Simple Sharing**‍

Charts are easy to version, share, and host on public or private servers.

### **Rollbacks**‍

**‍**Use helm rollback to roll back to an older version of a release with ease.

Helm + Botkube Integration  

-----------------------------

The official Botkube Helm executor plugin allows you to run Helm commands against your Kubernetes cluster directly from your configured chat platforms, including Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, and Mattermost. This allows you to view, manage, and even roll back Helm releases, and gives application developers a quick and easy way to see the status of their releases.
