Keptn Slack Integration Through Botkube
---------------------------------------

Botkube is a powerful tool that helps to simplify some of the most challenging aspects of using Keptn for cloud-native application delivery. One of the most significant benefits of Botkube is its ability to integrate natively with popular productivity tools like Slack Channels or Teams Channel. This integration makes it easy to control permissions and receive valuable alerts from Keptn about your Kubernetes cluster directly in your productivity tools. By doing this, you can save time and streamline your workflow, ensuring that critical information is delivered promptly and efficiently.

In addition to its native integrations, Botkube also offers a web-based GUI that makes it easy to deploy Keptn into your cluster quickly. This feature ensures that deployment is both faster and audited for correctness, making it an ideal solution for organizations that want to improve their application delivery processes. With Botkube, you can also monitor the status of your applications and receive alerts if there are any issues, ensuring that you can respond to problems quickly and efficiently.
