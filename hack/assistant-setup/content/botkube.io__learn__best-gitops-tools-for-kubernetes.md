**What is GitOps?**
-------------------

GitOps, the buzzword that's been buzzing around the DevOps world, is where the magic begins.

It's like having a magic wand that allows you to define, maintain, and automate your Kubernetes infrastructure using Git repositories as your all-knowing oracle.

With GitOps, every change is a well-documented journey into the heart of your infrastructure. You declare the desired state of your Kubernetes setup in code, and GitOps tools handle the rest, ensuring that your cluster always aligns with your vision. But enough theory—let's dive into the practical magic and explore the best GitOps tools for Kubernetes.
