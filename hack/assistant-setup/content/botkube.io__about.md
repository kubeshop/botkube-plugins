Started in 2019 Reimagined in 2022
----------------------------------

Botkube began as a tool forged in the fires of necessity.

2019

The [Infracloud team](https://www.infracloud.io/kubernetes-monitoring-tool/), faced with daily challenges of troubleshooting client Kubernetes clusters, dreamt of a solution that streamlined the process and empowered collaboration. This vision led to the birth of Botkube, a messaging bot designed to simplify cluster monitoring, debug deployments, and offer invaluable insights through automated checks.

As Botkube gained traction and the community rallied behind its potential, the [Kubeshop accelerator](https://kubeshop.io/) saw a kindred spirit.

2022

In 2021, Botkube joined the ranks of other innovative Kubernetes tools like Testkube, marking the dawn of a new era where collaboration and development drive the future of cluster management.

Now, Botkube stands poised to revolutionize the way we interact with Kubernetes, fueled by the passion of its creators and the unwavering support of its community.

Botkube is one of the three commercial products from Kubeshop, a first of its kind open source incubator and accelerator, focused on the challenges of Kubernetes and the cloud native ecosystem.

Benefits of Joining Kubeshop
----------------------------

Joining the [Kubeshop accelerator](https://kubeshop.io/) proved a boon for Botkube, offering a potent blend of sharedresources and collaboration with industry leaders.

Access to cutting-edge infrastructure and expertise facilitated rapid development, while close proximity to other top Kubernetes tools fostered cross-pollination of ideas and a vibrant collaborative spirit. The biggest draw, however, was the Kubeshop team's wealth of experience.

Working alongside seasoned veterans like Ole Lensmar—the CTO, and mastermind behind SOAP UI—provided invaluable mentorship and guidance, propelling Botkube's growth.

Additionally, the accelerator enabled Botkube to bolster its own team with seasoned professionals like  the product lead, Blair Rampling. His enterprise expertise honed at Red Hat proved instrumental in shaping Botkube for the big leagues.
