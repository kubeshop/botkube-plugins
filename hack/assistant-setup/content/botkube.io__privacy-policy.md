This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of Our Services, and for Our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

Like many businesses, We also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.

The information We collect includes:

1.  _Log and Usage Data._ Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information Our servers automatically collect when You access or use Our Services and which We record in log files. Depending on how You interact with Us, this log data may include Your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about Your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with Your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions You take such as which features You use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).

If a standard for online tracking is adopted that We must follow in the future, We will inform You about that practice in a revised version of this Policy.

4\. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

We will not discriminate against You if You exercise Your privacy rights.

#### Verification process

Upon receiving Your request, We will need to verify Your identity to determine You are the same person about whom We have the information in Our system. These verification efforts require Us to ask You to provide information so that We can match it with information You have previously provided Us. For instance, depending on the type of request You submit, We may ask You to provide certain information so that we can match the information You provide with the information We already have on file, or We may contact You through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that You have previously provided to Us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

We will only use personal information provided in Your request to verify Your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, We will avoid requesting additional information from You for the purposes of verification. However, if We cannot verify Your identity from the information already maintained by Us, We may request that You provide additional information for the purposes of verifying Your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as We finish verifying You.

#### Other privacy rights

You may object to the Processing of Your personal information.

You may request correction of Your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the Processing of the information.

You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on Your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on Your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.

Data Retention Policy
---------------------

### Purpose

At Botkube, we understand the importance of privacy and data protection. This policy outlines how we handle data deletion requests, and the steps we take to ensure that personal data is erased securely.

### Policy

For Users

User data is retained for as long as the account is in active status. Data enters an “archived” state when the account is voluntarily closed. Archived account data will be retained indefinitely. Users that wish to voluntarily close their account should download their data manually or via the API prior to closing their account.

If a user account is involuntarily suspended, there will be features which the account will be inaccessible but can be accessed if the customer meets their payment obligations and resolves any terms of service violations.

If a user wishes to manually backup their data in a suspended account, then they must ensure that their account is brought back to good standing so that the user interface will be available for their use. After three billing cycles the suspended account will be closed and the data will enter the “archived” state.

### Verification

Before we can delete any personal data, we will verify the identity of the individual making the request. We will only accept requests from the individual who owns the data, or from someone who is authorized to act on their behalf.

### Data Deletion Process

Once we have verified the identity of the individual making the request, we will delete all personal data associated with their account. This includes any data stored in our systems, backups, and archives. We will also notify any third-party services that we have shared the individual’s data with, and request that they delete the data as well.

### Data Retention

We will only retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or to be in compliance with local, state, and federal regulations. Once the data is no longer needed or is not required to be stored under an applicable regulation, we will securely delete it from our systems.

### Security

We take data security seriously, and have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, loss, or theft. All personal data will be securely deleted using industry-standard data wiping techniques.

### Conclusion

At Botkube, we are committed to protecting the privacy and personal data of our users. We will ensure that all data deletion requests are handled in a timely and secure manner, and that personal data is deleted in accordance with applicable data protection regulations.
