Title: SWEs vs. SREs: Teamwork for High-Performing Software

URL Source: https://botkube.io/learn/roles-of-swes-and-sres

Markdown Content:
Software engineers (SWEs) and site reliability engineers (SREs) play vital roles in modern software development. SWEs focus on the design, creation, and implementation of software features. On the other hand, SREs ensure the overall reliability, scalability, and performance of the systems that run this software.

\*Just to clear things up, this article is talking about SWE as a software developer, not the SWE Organization. The [SWE Organization](https://swe.org/about-swe/) stands for the Society of Women Engineers, which is another great cause we support, just not the topic of this article. Shout out to the two great women engineers on the Botkube team, [Maria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-ashby/) & [Kelly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellyrevenaugh/)!

**Shared Tools and Distinct Focus**
-----------------------------------

SWEs and SREs often overlap in their use of tools for testing and monitoring software. However, SREs dive deeper by using chaos engineering techniques to deliberately introduce failures, identifying potential vulnerabilities. SWEs prioritize tools that streamline the development process, like those for code management and release automation.

Later on in this article we will explore how these two roles work in a Kubernetes environment and tools that help with the collaboration between the two.

**Compensation Differences**
----------------------------

SREs often command higher salaries than SWEs at similar experience levels. This reflects the specialized skills SREs need in incident management, system troubleshooting, and ensuring the smooth operation of complex systems.

**Symbiosis in Software Development**
-------------------------------------

The relationship between SWEs and SREs is fundamentally collaborative. SWEs build the software, and SREs make sure it runs reliably and efficiently in production. This teamwork leads to the delivery of high-quality products that meet user expectations.

**SWEs, SREs, and Kubernetes**
------------------------------

In Kubernetes environments, the interaction between SWEs and SREs becomes even more pronounced. Typically, developers don't interact directly with the Kubernetes cluster until they push new code or encounter issues. This is where SWEs often rely heavily on SREs or DevOps engineers to troubleshoot the cluster before they can proceed with updates or fix problems.

**Botkube: Bridging the Gap**
-----------------------------

Botkube aims to smooth this interaction between SWEs and SREs by establishing developer self-service portals (SWE Self Service) within familiar chat platforms like Slack, Teams, or Discord. This allows developers to directly engage with Kubernetes for tasks like:

*   **Status Checks:** Getting a quick overview of cluster health.
*   **Pulling Logs:** Retrieving logs for troubleshooting.
*   **Restarting the Cluster:** Addressing basic issues without SRE intervention.
*   **Troubleshooting with AI ChatOps:** Leveraging Botkube's AI-powered commands for guided problem resolution.

Without developer buy-in into the infrastructure everything is run on, teams will experience friction when it comes to pushing new features and maintaining the cluster. This is where Botkube’s [Kubernetes collaboration features](https://botkube.io/features) help connect the SWE developer team with the DevOps team. Remove friction and have our AI assistant change common k8s issues, such as namespace naming, in seconds. As with most AI tools, our assistant only gets better as it learns. So expect more helpful k8s troubleshooting features coming soon!
