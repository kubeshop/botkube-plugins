Markdown Content:
As Kubernetes becomes increasingly popular in the enterprise, organizations are under pressure to ensure that their Kubernetes clusters are compliant with a variety of standards. This can be a daunting task, but it is essential to protect sensitive data and applications from security threats. Botkube is an open source tool that can be used to automate the compliance of Kubernetes clusters against a variety of standards, making it a valuable tool for the modern enterprise.

In this article, we will show you how Botkube can be used to automate Kubernetes compliance. We will start by providing an introduction to Botkube, including its features, benefits, and limitations. Then, we will discuss how Botkube can be used to automate the compliance of Kubernetes clusters against a variety of standards, including the CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks and the NSA/CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guidance. Finally, we will show how Botkube works with other Kubernetes tools for compliance.

**What is Botkube?**
--------------------

Botkube is a Cloud Native Kubernetes AI assistant that can be used to automate the deployment and compliance of Kubernetes clusters. It is also known as one of the easiest ways to connect a Kubernetes Slack Bot up to monitor errors and events within K8s clusters.

Botkube works by connecting to your Kubernetes cluster and running a series of checks to ensure that it is compliant with a variety of standards. It can also be used to automate the deployment of Kubernetes applications and services. Botkube is able to achieve this by connecting to many other popular K8s services such as Kubectl commands.

Botkube is already well known for it's [K8s Slack Integration](https://botkube.io/integration/slack). The Slack integration allows you to receive alerts and notifications about events in your Kubernetes cluster directly in your Slack workspace. This makes it easy to stay up-to-date on the status of your cluster and to troubleshoot any problems that may arise.

**How to Use Botkube for Kubernetes Automation & Compliance**
-------------------------------------------------------------

Botkube can be used to automate a variety of tasks related to Kubernetes, including pulling logs from the cluster. Normally to do this, you can use the /logs my-pod command in a terminal. See below in the Gif how Botkube automates these commands to run and pull directly in Slack!

Botkube will then pull the logs for the pod and send them to you in Slack. This is a great way to quickly troubleshoot problems in your Kubernetes cluster without having to SSH into the cluster or use the command line.

Botkube can also be used to automate other tasks related to Kubernetes, such as:

*   Deploying applications
*   Managing services
*   Monitoring the cluster
*   Scaling the cluster
*   Troubleshooting problems

By automating these tasks, Botkube can help you to save time and effort and to improve the security and reliability of your Kubernetes cluster.

In addition to automating complex commands, Botkube also breaks them down into smaller, more understandable steps. This makes it easier for users to understand what the command is doing and to troubleshoot any problems that may arise.

Finally, Botkube can be integrated with a variety of tools and services, such as Slack, Teams, and Prometheus. This makes it easy to get alerts and notifications about events in your Kubernetes cluster directly in your preferred workspace.

If you are looking for a powerful and easy-to-use tool to automate Kubernetes tasks, I recommend checking out Botkube.

**Other Kubernetes Automation Tools & Services Botkube Connects to:**
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Kubectl -**

Botkube integrates with Kubectl commands to allow users to run these commands directly from Slack, Mattermost, or Teams. This makes it easy to troubleshoot Kubernetes problems without having to switch back to the command line interface. For example, to run the kubectl get pods command, you would type /kubectl get pods in Slack. Botkube would then run the command and send the results to you in Slack.

Refer to our [Kubectl Cheatsheet](https://botkube.io/learn/kubectl-cheat-sheet) for additional useful advice on handling Kubectl.

### **Helm Charts -**

Botkube can be deployed with a [Helm Chart](https://botkube.io/learn/helm-charts), making it a great option for developers who are already using Helm. It is also a great way for DevOps engineers to get started with Helm, as Botkube can help them easily deploy Helm Charts and offer suggestions on correcting incorrect Helm Chart deployments.
