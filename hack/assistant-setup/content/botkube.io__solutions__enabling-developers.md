### Efficient Application Troubleshooting

Botkube gives developers access, context, and support that helps them streamline the application troubleshooting process directly in their preferred communication platforms.

Quick access to troubleshooting not only reduces downtime of applications but also creates faster resolution of issues. Developers gain the necessary insights and resources to independently address problems, without having to rely on busy operations teams. Developers want to write code, not learn new Kubernetes commands. Botkubeâ€™s interactive command creation gives them the power to get what they need without learning complex CLIs.

### Increased Developer Productivity

Providing developers with tools to monitor and troubleshoot applications directly from their communication platform, like Microsoft Teams or Slack, enhances their productivity.

With Botkube, developers can quickly address issues without reliance on operations teams, streamlining the troubleshooting process and allowing developers to focus on coding and improving applications.

### Time Savings for DevOps Teams

Botkube's capabilities alleviate the burden on operations teams by empowering developers to handle application troubleshooting tasks themselves.

Rather than responding to requests for logs and other help, DevOps teams can use that extra time to ensure the overall reliability and performance of the infrastructure. Ops teams can focus on strategic tasks and proactively manage the health of the IT environment, while Devs can self-service their requests and get the information they need.
