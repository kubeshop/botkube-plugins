Mattermost is a team communication software that emphasizes its open-source nature, which means that its source code is publicly available and can be freely used, modified, and distributed by anyone. It provides a secure and flexible messaging platform with real-time messaging, file sharing, search, and integrations with popular tools. Being open-source allows Mattermost to be customized to meet the needs of teams of all sizes, offering complete control over data and infrastructure. It is often chosen as an alternative to proprietary messaging platforms because it provides greater flexibility and control over the technology stack, enabling teams to innovate and build on top of the platform.

*   Real-time messaging: Mattermost provides a secure and flexible messaging platform with real-time messaging, file sharing, search, and integrations with popular tools.
*   Customizable: Being open-source allows Mattermost to be customized to meet the needs of teams of all sizes, offering complete control over data and infrastructure.
*   Self-hosted: Mattermost can be installed on-premises or on a cloud platform of your choice, providing complete control over your data and infrastructure.
*   Kubernetes-compatible: Mattermost can be installed within Kubernetes, enabling teams to easily deploy and manage the software using Kubernetes tools and workflows.
*   Security and compliance: Mattermost offers advanced features such as end-to-end encryption, compliance and governance controls, and webhooks and APIs for developers to ensure security and compliance with regulations.
*   Integration-ready: Mattermost can be integrated with a variety of popular tools and platforms, such as GitHub, Jira, and Trello, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows and toolchains.

Kubernetes in Mattermost Before Botkube
---------------------------------------

Previously, Kubernetes users had to use manual webhooks to receive notifications in Mattermost, which was a tedious and time-consuming process. However, with Botkube's integration with Mattermost, this process has become much simpler. Botkube provides error alerts and ChatOps functions that can be easily integrated into Mattermost, allowing users to receive notifications without having to set up manual webhooks. This integration stack also enables users to stay true to Open Source solutions while building their applications. Developers can now focus on their work instead of dealing with the complexities of setting up manual webhooks, which results in greater productivity and efficiency.

Mattermost + Botkube K8s Integration
------------------------------------

Botkube has become the Kubernetes Integration partner for Mattermost, allowing users to receive Kubernetes-related alerts directly in their Mattermost channels. Botkube provides a seamless integration with Mattermost, which enables teams to collaborate more effectively by providing real-time notifications on Kubernetes cluster events, such as pod failures, deployments, and autoscaling. With Botkube, users can easily share permissions to their Kubernetes cluster through a shared team channel, ensuring that the right people have access to the right resources. Additionally, Botkube provides the ability to perform Kubernetes cluster commands directly from Mattermost, allowing users to restart their cluster or perform general maintenance tasks from their local machine without having to switch between different tools. This integration between Botkube and Mattermost streamlines Kubernetes operations, providing a more efficient and effective way to manage your Kubernetes clusters.
