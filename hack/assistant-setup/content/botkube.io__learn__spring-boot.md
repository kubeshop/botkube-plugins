If you are a Java developer who wants to work in a commercial setting, chances are you will encounter Kubernetes as the preferred platform for deploying and managing your applications. Kubernetes offers many advantages such as scalability, reliability, and portability, but it also comes with its own challenges and learning curve. How can you easily migrate your existing Java applications to Kubernetes and troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the deployment process? This is where Spring Boot and Botkube come in handy.

What is Spring Boot?
--------------------

Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that can run on Kubernetes. Spring Boot provides features such as:

*   Auto-configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to your project.
    
*   Embedded servers: Spring Boot embeds Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow directly into your executable jar or war file, so you don't need to deploy your application to an external server.
    
*   Starter dependencies: Spring Boot provides a set of starter dependencies that let you quickly add common functionality to your application, such as web, data access, security, testing, etc.
    
*   Actuator: Spring Boot provides a set of endpoints that let you monitor and manage your application, such as health, metrics, beans, env, etc.
    

With Springboot, you can create a fully functional Java application that can be packaged as a container image and deployed on Kubernetes with minimal configuration.

What is Botkube?
----------------

Botkube is an app that helps you monitor your Kubernetes cluster, debug critical deployments, and get recommendations for standard practices by running checks on Kubernetes resources. Botkube can be integrated with multiple messaging platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, or Mattermost to help you communicate with your cluster from your chat tool. Botkube has the following features:

*   Monitoring: Botkube monitors your cluster events and sends notifications to your chat tool when something changes. You can also filter the events based on namespaces, resources, or actions.
    
*   ChatOps: Botkube lets you execute kubectl commands on your cluster from your chat tool. You can also use helm commands to install or upgrade charts. Botkube supports interactive command creation for some platforms, making it easier for non-experts to work with Kubernetes.
    
*   Automation: Botkube allows you to automatically run commands based on specific events and see the results in the event message. You can use this feature to gather logs and other details on errors, get descriptions of newly created resources, or even auto-rollback failed deployments and upgrades with simple configuration steps.
    
*   Extensibility: Botkube supports plugins that let you add new sources and executors for any tools. You can use plugins to enable any tool for ChatOps and automation with easy-to-use APIs and Botkube as the engine.
    

With Botkube, you can monitor and manage your Spring Boot applications on Kubernetes from your chat tool without switching contexts.

How to Use Botkube with Springboot Kubernetes?
----------------------------------------------

To use Botkube with Spring Boot, you need to do the following steps:

1.  Create a Spring Boot application using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). Choose the dependencies you need for your application, such as web, data access, security, etc. Download and unzip the project folder.
2.  Build a container image for your application using [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib). Jib is a tool that builds optimized Docker and OCI images for Java applications without a Docker daemon. Add the Jib plugin to your pom.xml file and run \`mvn compile jib:build\` to build and push the image to a registry of your choice.
3.  Deploy your application on Kubernetes using [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/). Skaffold is a tool that automates the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying applications on Kubernetes. Create a skaffold.yaml file that defines how to build and deploy your application using Jib and kubectl or helm. Run \`skaffold dev\` to start a continuous development mode that watches for changes in your source code or configuration files and updates your application on the cluster.
4.  Install Botkube on your cluster using [Helm](https://helm.sh/). Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that lets you install and manage applications using charts. Add the Botkube chart repository and install the botkube chart with the configuration options for your chat platform. Get started with Botkube for free with our new [cloud app](https://botkube.io/blog/introducing-botkube-v1-0-the-future-of-kubernetes-troubleshooting).
5.  Configure Botkube to monitor and manage your application from the Cloud Based Web GUI. At this point Botkube should be connected to your instance and a channel in your messaging platform. Simply select the notifications you want to receive from the services and invite all the needed DevOps & SRE team members.

**Conclusion**
--------------

After the setup anyone can view and run necessary commands from one single channel in Slack. No more switching back and forth to run CLI commands when an error shows up! This brings security and flexibility to running your Java application within Kubernetes all through Slack. Slack is also mobile, so those error reports and ChatOps fixes Botkube bring can go wherever you go.

In conclusion, Botkube empowers DevOps engineers with the agility and precision needed for streamlined Springboot deployments on Kubernetes. By automating routine tasks, Botkube significantly reduces deployment time and effort. Moreover, its built-in troubleshooting features provide invaluable assistance in pinpointing and resolving errors, expediting the debugging process. With Botkube, DevOps engineers can confidently manage Springboot Kubernetes deployments, ensuring efficient and reliable application delivery.
