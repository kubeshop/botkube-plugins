Markdown Content:
In the ever evolving Kubernetes landscape, ensuring optimal management and operations is paramount. One key way to improving workflows is Developer  Self-Service in Kubernetes, which plays a vital role in the software development lifecycle.

Developers face two main challenges: _they must either rely on getting their Kubernetes resources from their operations team or become Kubernetes experts themselves._

_‍_These scenarios delay the swift rollout of new features and solutions. Botkube enables developers to access their Kubernetes resources easily without needing to become a Kubernetes expert.

Through Botkube’s Slack interactivity features, developers can perform tasks like running common **kubectl** commands such as **kubectl describe** and **kubectl get pods** — without the need to learn the syntax or navigate the command-line terminal.

Join the Botkube team for an insightful session on how we enable Kubernetes Developer Self-Service, a transformative approach to Kubernetes management and operations.

In this session, we will deep dive into best practices that are improving the way developers interact with Kubernetes clusters like Slack interactivity and command builder, aliases, and automation.

*   Learn how users can interact with Kubernetes directly from Slack or MS Teams, no deep K8s knowledge required
*   Discover the benefits of creating Botkube automations
*   Learn about collaborative troubleshooting techniques like aliases

**Special Interview**  
**‍**We’ll talk with some members of Botkube engineering team to learn how they leverage Botkube’s features to enhance their operational efficiency — ensuring timely releases and maintaining high standards of product quality.

‍**Who should attend?**  
DevOps Engineers, Software Developers, and SREs - or anyone in-between. This event is perfect for those looking to enhance their Kubernetes troubleshooting skills or explore the benefits of collaborative alerting and monitoring.
