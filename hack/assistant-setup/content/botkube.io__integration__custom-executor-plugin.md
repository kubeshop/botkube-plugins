Building Custom Bots to Execute Kubernetes Commands
---------------------------------------------------

Botkube, already a master of Kubernetes notifications in Slack and Teams, noticed a gap: users often needed to run specific commands for their clusters directly from their chat channels. Instead of forcing them to jump between tools, Botkube embraced the need for customization. Now, users can build their own "executors" â€“ small scripts that combine existing tools like Helm packages or, as Huseyn demonstrated, even [Keptn for cluster backups](https://botkube.io/blog/implementing-your-own-botkube-plugin-a-real-life-use-case). This seamless integration empowers teams to manage their Kubernetes clusters with ease and agility, all within their familiar communication platforms.

We allow custom Kubernetes resources to bridge the gap across DevOps, enabling bots to manage and monitor your deployed services like never before.
