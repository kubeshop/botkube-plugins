When running a program or script, you may encounter an exit code 125 error. This can be frustrating and confusing, especially if you are not familiar with exit codes and their meanings. In this article, we will discuss what exit code 125 means and provide expert advice on how to resolve this issue.

Understanding Exit Codes
------------------------

Before we dive into resolving exit code 125 issues, it is important to understand what exit codes are and how they work. An exit code is a number that is returned by a program or script when it finishes running. This code can indicate whether the program or script was successful or if there was an error. Exit codes range from 0 to 255, with 0 indicating success and any other number indicating an error.

Exit code 125 is a specific error code that indicates a command or program was not found. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a typo in the command or the program not being installed on your system. It is important to note that exit code 125 is not a universal error code and can vary depending on the operating system and programming language being used.

Troubleshooting Exit Code 125
-----------------------------

If you encounter an exit code 125 error, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

### Check for Typos

The first thing you should do is double-check the command or program name for any typos. Even a small mistake can result in an exit code 125 error. Make sure to check for any missing or extra characters, as well as any incorrect capitalization.

### Verify Program Installation

If you are running a program and receiving an exit code 125 error, it is possible that the program is not installed on your system. Make sure to check that the program is installed and that you are using the correct command to run it.

### Check File Permissions

In some cases, an exit code 125 error can be caused by file permissions. If the program or script you are trying to run does not have the proper permissions, it may result in an exit code 125 error. Make sure to check the file permissions and adjust them if necessary.

### Use a Different Shell

If you are using a specific shell or terminal to run your commands, try using a different one. Sometimes, certain shells may not recognize a command or program, resulting in an exit code 125 error. Switching to a different shell may resolve the issue.

### Consult Documentation or Seek Help

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, it may be helpful to consult the documentation for the program or script you are trying to run. You can also seek help from online forums or communities for the specific programming language or operating system you are using. Experts in these communities may be able to provide more specific advice for resolving exit code 125 issues.
