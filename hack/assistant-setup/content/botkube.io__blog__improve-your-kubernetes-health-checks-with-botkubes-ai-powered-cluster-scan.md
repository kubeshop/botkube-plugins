Why Kubernetes Health Checks Matter
-----------------------------------

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform, but its complexity can make it challenging to maintain optimal performance and security. Traditional monitoring tools often require significant manual effort to analyze logs, metrics, and configurations. This reactive approach can lead to prolonged downtime and suboptimal performance. Botkube's AI-powered cluster scan offers a proactive solution, providing you with real-time insights and helpful recommendations to keep your cluster running smoothly.
