**ChatGPT - A More Generic Approach to Kubernetes AI Tooling**
--------------------------------------------------------------

ChatGPT, the versatile language model from OpenAI, can also assist with Kubernetes queries. While beneficial, these drawbacks exist:

*   **Manual Process:** Requires you to manually formulate questions and interpret responses.
*   **Not Kubernetes-Specific:** You might need to create a dedicated agent trained extensively on Kubernetes and DevOps knowledge to gain maximum value.

Botkube integrates OpenAI's language model, allowing you to harness the power of ChatGPT-like technology directly within your workflows for even greater ease.

**K8sGPT: A Noteworthy Side Project**
-------------------------------------

While tools like K8sGPT provide additional AI capabilities for Kubernetes, it's important to acknowledge that they are often community-driven side projects. This raises questions about long-term support and future development of an open-source project.
