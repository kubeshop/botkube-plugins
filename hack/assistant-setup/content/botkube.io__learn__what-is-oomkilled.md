URL Source: https://botkube.io/learn/what-is-oomkilled

Markdown Content:
OOMKilled is an error that occurs when a container or pod in Kubernetes uses more memory than it is allowed. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a memory leak, a bug in the application, or a spike in traffic. When a container or pod is terminated due to OOMKilled, it will not be able to recover and will need to be restarted.

**How to View the Error Message**
---------------------------------

If you see an OOMKilled error, you can view the error message by running the following command:

`kubectl logs <pod_name>`

The error message will show you the name of the container that was terminated and the reason for the termination.

**What is Error Code 137?**
---------------------------

Error Code 137 is the exit code that is returned when a container or pod is terminated due to OOMKilled. You can see the error code by running the following command:

`kubectl get pod <pod_name> -o yaml`

The error code will be listed in the "Status" section of the pod's YAML definition.

**How to Prevent OOMKilled**
----------------------------

There are a few things that can be done to prevent OOMKilled in Kubernetes. One is to set memory limits on containers and pods. This will prevent containers from using more memory than they are allowed. Another is to use a memory profiler to identify and fix memory leaks. Finally, it is important to monitor your Kubernetes cluster for signs of OOMKilled errors. If you see an OOMKilled error, you can take steps to troubleshoot the issue and prevent it from happening again.

**How to Troubleshoot OOMKilled**
---------------------------------

If you see an OOMKilled error, you can take the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1.  Identify the container or pod that was terminated.
2.  Check the memory usage of the container or pod.
3.  Look for any errors in the container or pod logs.
4.  Update the container or pod image.
5.  Increase the memory limit for the container or pod.

**Conclusion**
--------------

OOMKilled is an error that can cause significant disruptions to your Kubernetes applications. By following the tips in this article, you can help to prevent OOMKilled and keep your applications running smoothly.
